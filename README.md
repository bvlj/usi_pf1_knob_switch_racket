# Knob and Switch computer in DrRacket

[![logo banner](res/banner.png)](#)

This is a Racket implementation of the [Knob and Switch computer](https://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/langheinrich/edu/KandS2/) we have known
during the CA course.

The Knob & Switch Computer uses an intuitive metaphor and an interactive approach to introduce
introductory CS students to the big ideas in computer organization.
