# Knob and Switch computer in DrRacket

## Team

* Bevilacqua Joey
* Brunner Nicola

## Roadmap

Our Idea was to create a Program that imitates the _"Knob and Switch Computer"_ that we have known in CA.

1. First thing we have done, was to inspect the original _"Knob and Switch Computer"_ and analyse it.

2. Second we have built the graphic user interface, using **Racket/gui**.

3. We have implemented the basic Datapath witch includes the Buses, Registers and Switches.

### To do

We are working on the Memory (to store and read data), on the automatic execution and maybe on a stepper.
We also have planned to make a Microinstruction Interpreter, for executing a Microprogram from a .csv file.
