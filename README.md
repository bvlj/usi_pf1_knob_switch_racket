# Knob and Switch computer in DrRacket

Our idea was to create a Program that imitates the _"Knob and Switch Computer"_ that we have known in CA.

## Team

* Bevilacqua Joey
* Brunner Nicola


## Roadmap

### Done

1. Create a graphical user interface using **racket/gui**
2. Implement the basic Datapath which includes the Buses, Registers and Switches
3. Full-cycle and per-step execution
4. Memory support (and visualization)
5. MicroInstructions interpreter to execute a MicroProgram from a given file

### To do

6. Decouple functional part from obj-oriented using a world abstraction
7. Status indicator
8. Documentation
